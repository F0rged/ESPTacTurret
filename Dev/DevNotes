-=-=-=-=-=-  Regarding Steppers: -=-=-=-=-=-  
ESPHome sleep mode works and eliminates the hummning noise, however it causes the stepper to have issues with tiny steps.
Sending 1 step commands to the stepper causes a studder.  This may not be an issue under normal conditions, but something to watch out for.
Also, changing the A4988 board from running at 5v to 3.3v may also have eliminated the humming noise anyways.
